  In order to manage multiple agencies
  As a system administrator
  I want to be able to create agency

  Scenario Create Agency
    Given I am system administrator
    And I go to agency list page
    When I fill in the name of the agency with "John Doe Agency"
    And I press Create
    Then I should see "agency successfully created"
